	abstract = {Orson Welles considered The Magnificent Ambersons the crucial turning point in his career. He said, "They destroyed Ambersons and it destroyed me." In 1942, while Welles was away, {RKO} Studios drastically recut the completed film. None of that deleted footage is known to survive. Now film scholar Robert Carringer has reconstructed Welles's own version of Ambersons, using all available surviving evidence including rare studio documents and the recollections of Welles himself and other original participants in the film. Carringer reaches startling conclusions about where the responsibility for the film's undoing ultimately lies. His spellbinding—and no doubt controversial—book will be eagerly welcomed by film historians and enthusiasts.},

The smoothness of the ﬁnal surface is an explicit parameter in the method, and the bandlimit of the smoothed surface is proportional to its smoothness. Several numerical examples are provided in the context of acoustic scattering. In particular, we compare scattered ﬁelds from smoothed geometries in two dimensions with those from polygonal domains. We observe that signiﬁcant reductions in computational cost can be obtained if merely approximate solutions are desired in the near- or far-ﬁeld. Provided that the smoothing is sub-wavelength, the error of the scattered ﬁeld is proportional to the size of the geometry that is modiﬁed.},

The pressure exterior to the channel is assumed to be constant. Although this problem has been well studied, typical studies assume that the permeability of the wall is small relative to other nondimensional parameters; this work relaxes this assumption and explores a regime in parameter space that has not yet been well studied. A consequence of this relaxation is that transverse velocity is no longer necessarily small when compared with the axial velocity. We use our result to explore how existing asymptotic theories break down in the limit of large permeability for channels of small length.},

	abstract = {We show how to extend a recently proposed multi-level Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational complexity needed to compute expected values of functions of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The extension is non-trivial, exploiting a coupling of the requisite processes that is easy to simulate while providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and in a stark departure from other implementations of multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased estimator that is significantly less computationally expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the basic computational complexity of current approaches that have many names and variants across the scientific literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled chemical reaction networks provide a very important application for this work. Hence, we use this context for our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and computational examples.},

We describe the construction of four different quadratures which handle logarithmically-singular kernels. Only smooth boundaries are considered, but some of the techniques extend straightforwardly to the case of corners. Three are modifications of the global periodic trapezoid rule, due to Kapur–Rokhlin, to Alpert, and to Kress. The fourth is a modification to a quadrature based on Gauss–Legendre panels due to Kolm–Rokhlin; this formulation allows adaptivity. We compare in numerical experiments the convergence of the four schemes in various settings, including low- and high-frequency planar Helmholtz problems, and 3D axisymmetric Laplace problems. We also find striking differences in performance in an iterative setting. We summarize the relative advantages of the schemes.},

A centerpiece of our method is the highly accurate special quadrature method, which is based on a combination of upsampled quadrature and quadrature by expansion, accelerated using a precomputation scheme. The method is demonstrated for rodlike and spheroidal particles, with the confining geometry given by a pipe or a pair of flat walls. A parameter selection strategy for the special quadrature method is presented and tested. Periodic interactions are computed using the spectral Ewald fast summation method, which allows our method to run in O(n log n) time for n grid points in the primary cell, assuming the number of geometrical objects grows while the grid point concentration is kept fixed.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3127},
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with elucidating a relationship between two common coupling methods for the continuous time Markov chain models utilized in the cell biology literature. The couplings considered here are primarily used in a computational framework by providing reductions in variance for different Monte Carlo estimators, thereby allowing for significantly more accurate results for a fixed amount of computational time. Common applications of the couplings include the estimation of parametric sensitivities via finite difference methods and the estimation of expectations via multi-level Monte Carlo algorithms. While a number of coupling strategies have been proposed for the models considered here, and a number of articles have experimentally compared the different strategies, to date there has been no mathematical analysis describing the connections between them. Such analyses are critical in order to determine the best use for each. In the current paper, we show a connection between the common reaction path ({CRP}) method and the split coupling ({SC}) method, which is termed coupled finite differences ({CFD}) in the parametric sensitivities literature. In particular, we show that the two couplings are both limits of a third coupling strategy we call the "local-{CRP}" coupling, with the split coupling method arising as a key parameter goes to infinity, and the common reaction path coupling arising as the same parameter goes to zero. The analysis helps explain why the split coupling method often provides a lower variance than does the common reaction path method, a fact previously shown experimentally.},

The key ingredient is a set of panel quadrature rules capable of evaluating weakly-singular, nearly-singular and hyper-singular integrals to high accuracy. Near-singular integral evaluation, in particular, is done using an extension of the scheme developed in J. Helsing and R. Ojala, J. Comput. Phys. 227 (2008) 2899–2921. The boundary of the given geometry is “panelized” automatically to achieve user-prescribed precision.

In one example, for instance, a model 2D vascular network with 378 corners required less than 200K discretization points to obtain a 9-digit solution accuracy.},

Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo variants of approximate Bayesian computation can be effective techniques for sampling posterior distributions in an approximate Bayesian computation setting. However, without careful consideration of convergence criteria and selection of proposal kernels, such methods can lead to very biased inference or computationally inefficient sampling. In contrast, rejection sampling for approximate Bayesian computation, despite being computationally intensive, results in independent, identically distributed samples from the approximated posterior. An alternative method is proposed for the acceleration of likelihood-free Bayesian inference that applies multilevel Monte Carlo variance reduction techniques directly to rejection sampling. The resulting method retains the accuracy advantages of rejection sampling while significantly improving the computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {Tau-leaping is a popular discretization method for generating approximate paths of continuous time, discrete space, Markov chains, notably for biochemical reaction systems. To compute expected values in this context, an appropriate multilevel Monte Carlo form of tau-leaping has been shown to improve efficiency dramatically. In this work we derive new analytic results concerning the computational complexity of multilevel Monte Carlo tau-leaping that are significantly sharper than previous ones. We avoid taking asymptotic limits, and focus on a practical setting where the system size is large enough for many events to take place along a path, so that exact simulation of paths is expensive, making tau-leaping an attractive option. We use a general scaling of the system components that allows for the reaction rate constants and the abundances of species to vary over several orders of magnitude, and we exploit the random time change representation developed by Kurtz. The key feature of the analysis that allows for the sharper bounds is that when comparing relevant pairs of processes we analyze the variance of their difference directly rather than bounding via the second moment. Use of the second moment is natural in the setting of a diffusion equation, where multilevel was first developed and where strong convergence results for numerical methods are readily available, but is not optimal for the Poisson-driven jump systems that we consider here. We also present computational results that illustrate the new analysis.},

	abstract = {The two-dimensional scattering of water waves over a finite region of arbitrarily 
varying topography linking two semi-infinite regions of constant depth is considered. 
Unlike many approaches to this problem, the formulation employed is exact in the 
context of linear theory, utilizing simple combinations of Green's functions appropriate 
to water of constant depth and the Cauchy–Riemann equations to derive a 
system of coupled integral equations for components of the fluid velocity at certain 
locations. Two cases arise, depending on whether the deepest point of the topography 
does or does not lie below the lower of the semi-infinite horizontal bed sections. 
In each, the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes are related to the incoming 
wave amplitudes by a scattering matrix which is defined in terms of inner products 
involving the solution of the corresponding integral equation system.
            This solution is approximated by using the variational method in conjunction with 
a judicious choice of trial function which correctly models the fluid behaviour at the 
free surface and near the joins of the varying topography with the constant-depth 
sections, which may not be smooth. The numerical results are remarkably accurate, 
with just a two-term trial function giving three decimal places of accuracy in the 
reflection and transmission coefficents in most cases, whilst increasing the number of 
terms in the trial function results in rapid convergence. The method is applied to a 
range of examples.},

	abstract = {Statistical signal processing applications usually require the estimation of some parameters of interest given a set of observed data. These estimates are typically obtained either by solving a multi-variate optimization problem, as in the maximum likelihood ({ML}) or maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimators, or by performing a multi-dimensional integration, as in the minimum mean squared error ({MMSE}) estimators. Unfortunately, analytical expressions for these estimators cannot be found in most real-world applications, and the Monte Carlo ({MC}) methodology is one feasible approach. {MC} methods proceed by drawing random samples, either from the desired distribution or from a simpler one, and using them to compute consistent estimators. The most important families of {MC} algorithms are the Markov chain {MC} ({MCMC}) and importance sampling ({IS}). On the one hand, {MCMC} methods draw samples from a proposal density, building then an ergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution by accepting or rejecting those candidate samples as the new state of the chain. On the other hand, {IS} techniques draw samples from a simple proposal density and then assign them suitable weights that measure their quality in some appropriate way. In this paper, we perform a thorough review of {MC} methods for the estimation of static parameters in signal processing applications. A historical note on the development of {MC} schemes is also provided, followed by the basic {MC} method and a brief description of the rejection sampling ({RS}) algorithm, as well as three sections describing many of the most relevant {MCMC} and {IS} algorithms, and their combined use. Finally, five numerical examples (including the estimation of the parameters of a chaotic system, a localization problem in wireless sensor networks and a spectral analysis application) are provided in order to demonstrate the performance of the described approaches.},

We restrict our attention here to the Poisson, modiﬁed Helmholtz, Stokes and modiﬁed Stokes equations. The approach extends to the oscillatory equations of mathematical physics, including the Helmholtz and Maxwell equations, but we will address these in a companion paper, since the nature of the problem is somewhat diﬀerent and includes the consideration of quasiperiodic boundary conditions and resonances. Unlike lattice sumbased methods, the scheme is insensitive to the unit cell’s aspect ratio and is easily coupled to adaptive fast multipole methods ({FMMs}). Our analysis relies on classical “plane-wave” representations of the fundamental solution, and yields an explicit low-rank representation of the ﬁeld due to all image sources beyond the ﬁrst layer of neighboring unit cells. When the aspect ratio of the unit cell is large, our scheme can be coupled with the nonuniform fast Fourier transform ({NUFFT}) to accelerate the evaluation of the induced ﬁeld. Its performance is illustrated with several numerial examples.},

	abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) proves to be powerful for Bayesian inference and in particular for exoplanet radial velocity ﬁtting because {MCMC} provides more statistical information and makes better use of data than common approaches like chi-square ﬁtting. However, the nonlinear density functions encountered in these problems can make {MCMC} time-consuming. In this paper, we apply an ensemble sampler respecting afﬁne invariance to orbital parameter extraction from radial velocity data. This new sampler has only one free parameter, and does not require much tuning for good performance, which is important for automatization. The autocorrelation time of this sampler is approximately the same for all parameters and far smaller than Metropolis–Hastings, which means it requires many fewer function calls to produce the same number of independent samples. The afﬁne-invariant sampler speeds up {MCMC} by hundreds of times compared with Metropolis–Hastings in the same computing situation. This novel sampler would be ideal for projects involving large data sets such as statistical investigations of planet distribution. The biggest obstacle to ensemble samplers is the existence of multiple local optima; we present a clustering technique to deal with local optima by clustering based on the likelihood of the walkers in the ensemble. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the sampler on real radial velocity data.},

	abstract = {We review adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms ({MCMC}) as a mean to optimise their performance. Using simple toy examples we review their theoretical underpinnings, and in particular show why adaptive {MCMC} algorithms might fail when some fundamental properties are not satisﬁed. This leads to guidelines concerning the design of correct algorithms. We then review criteria and the useful framework of stochastic approximation, which allows one to systematically optimise generally used criteria, but also analyse the properties of adaptive {MCMC} algorithms. We then propose a series of novel adaptive algorithms which prove to be robust and reliable in practice. These algorithms are applied to artiﬁcial and high dimensional scenarios, but also to the classic mine disaster dataset inference problem.},

The advantages of this approach are twofold: ﬁrst, the velocity is automatically divergence free, and second, complicated (nonlocal) boundary conditions for the vorticity are avoided. The disadvantage is that the solution of a nonlinear fourth-order partial diﬀerential equation is required. By recasting this partial diﬀerential equation as an integral equation, we avoid the ill-conditioning which hampers ﬁnite diﬀerence and ﬁnite element methods in this environment. By using fast algorithms for the evaluation of volume integrals, we are able to solve the equations using O(M ) or O(M log M ) operations, where M is the number of points in the discretization of the domain.},

	abstract = {Reaction–diffusion models describing the movement, reproduction and death of individuals within a population are key mathematical modelling tools with widespread applications in mathematical biology. A diverse range of such continuum models have been applied in various biological contexts by choosing different ﬂux and source terms in the reaction–diffusion framework. For example, to describe the collective spreading of cell populations, the ﬂux term may be chosen to reﬂect various movement mechanisms, such as random motion (diffusion), adhesion, haptotaxis, chemokinesis and chemotaxis. The choice of ﬂux terms in speciﬁc applications, such as wound healing, is usually made heuristically, and rarely it is tested quantitatively against detailed cell density data. More generally, in mathematical biology, the questions of model validation and model selection have not received the same attention as the questions of model development and model analysis. Many studies do not consider model validation or model selection, and those that do often base the selection of the model on residual error criteria after model calibration is performed using nonlinear regression techniques. In this work, we present a model selection case study, in the context of cell invasion, with a very detailed experimental data set. Using Bayesian analysis and information criteria, we demonstrate that model selection and model validation should account for both residual errors and model complexity. These considerations are often overlooked in the mathematical biology literature. The results we present here provide a straightforward methodology that can be used to guide model selection across a range of applications. Furthermore, the case study we present provides a clear example where neglecting the role of model complexity can give rise to misleading outcomes.},

	abstract = {Likelihood-free Bayesian inference algorithms are popular methods for calibrating the parameters of complex, stochastic models, required when the likelihood of the observed data is intractable. These algorithms characteristically rely heavily on repeated model simulations. However, whenever the computational cost of simulation is even moderately expensive, the significant burden incurred by likelihood-free algorithms leaves them unviable in many practical applications. The multifidelity approach has been introduced (originally in the context of approximate Bayesian computation) to reduce the simulation burden of likelihood-free inference without loss of accuracy, by using the information provided by simulating computationally cheap, approximate models in place of the model of interest. The first contribution of this work is to demonstrate that multifidelity techniques can be applied in the general likelihood-free Bayesian inference setting. Analytical results on the optimal allocation of computational resources to simulations at different levels of fidelity are derived, and subsequently implemented practically. We provide an adaptive multifidelity likelihood-free inference algorithm that learns the relationships between models at different fidelities and adapts resource allocation accordingly, and demonstrate that this algorithm produces posterior estimates with near-optimal efficiency.},

	title = {Multiﬁdelity multilevel Monte Carlo to accelerate approximate Bayesian parameter inference for partially observed stochastic processes},
	abstract = {Models of stochastic processes are widely used in almost all ﬁelds of science. Theory validation, parameter estimation, and prediction all require model calibration and statistical inference using data. However, data are almost always incomplete observations of reality. This leads to a great challenge for statistical inference because the likelihood function will be intractable for almost all partially observed stochastic processes. This renders many statistical methods, especially within a Bayesian framework, impossible to implement. Therefore, computationally expensive likelihood-free approaches are applied that replace likelihood evaluations with realisations of the model and observation process. For accurate inference, however, likelihood-free techniques may require millions of expensive stochastic simulations. To address this challenge, we develop a new method based on recent advances in multilevel and multiﬁdelity methods for parameter inference using partially observed Markov processes. Our novel approach combines the multilevel Monte Carlo telescoping summation, applied to a sequence of approximate Bayesian posterior targets, with a multiﬁdelity rejection sampler that learns from computationally inexpensive model approximations to minimise the number of computationally expensive exact simulations required for accurate inference. We present the derivation of our new algorithm for likelihood-free Bayesian inference, discuss practical implementation details, and demonstrate substantial performance improvements. Using examples from systems biology, we demonstrate improvements of more than two orders of magnitude over standard rejection sampling techniques. Our approach is generally applicable to accelerate other sampling schemes, such as sequential Monte Carlo, to enable feasible Bayesian analysis for realistic practical applications in physics, chemistry, biology, epidemiology, ecology and economics. We provide source code implementations of our methods and demonstrations (available at https://github.com/davidwarne/{MLMCandMultiﬁdelityForABC}).},

Despite the fact that the underlying optimization problem is formally ill-posed and nonconvex, recursive linearization requires only the solution of a sequence of linear least squares problems at successively higher frequencies. By seeking a suitably band-limited approximation of the sound speed profile, we ensure that each least squares calculation is well-conditioned so that an iterative solver can be effectively applied. Each matrix-vector product involves the solution of a large number of forward scattering problems, for which we have created a new, spectrally accurate, fast direct solver. For the largest problems considered, involving 19,600 unknowns, approximately 1 million partial differential equations were solved, requiring approximately 2 days to compute using a parallel {MATLAB} implementation on a multicore workstation.},

We show that the improvements generated by each of {ABC}-{SMC} and {MF}-{ABC} to the efficiency of generating Monte Carlo samples and estimates from the {ABC} posterior are amplified when the two techniques are used together.},

Likelihood-free parameter inference methods, such as approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}), build Monte Carlo samples of the uncertain parameter distribution by comparing the data with large numbers of model simulations. However, the computational expense of generating these simulations forms a significant bottleneck in the practical application of such methods. We identify how simulations of corresponding cheap, low-fidelity models have been used separately in two complementary ways to reduce the computational expense of building these samples, at the cost of introducing additional variance to the resulting parameter estimates. We explore how these approaches can be unified so that cost and benefit are optimally balanced, and we characterize the optimal choice of how often to simulate from cheap, low-fidelity models in place of expensive, highfidelity models in Monte Carlo {ABC} algorithms. The resulting early accept/reject multifidelity {ABC} algorithm that we propose is shown to give improved performance over existing multifidelity and high-fidelity approaches.},

However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects.

Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, signiﬁcant eﬀort has been spent in recent decades on the development of eﬃcient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian Computation ({ABC}) is a popular computational method for likelihood-free Bayesian inference. The term "likelihood-free" refers to problems where the likelihood is intractable to compute or estimate directly, but where it is possible to generate simulated data \$X\$ relatively easily given a candidate set of parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\$ simulated from a prior distribution. Parameters which generate simulated data within some tolerance \${\textbackslash}delta\$ of the observed data \$x{\textasciicircum}*\$ are regarded as plausible, and a collection of such \${\textbackslash}theta\$ is used to estimate the posterior distribution \${\textbackslash}theta{\textbackslash},{\textbar}{\textbackslash},X{\textbackslash}!={\textbackslash}!x{\textasciicircum}*\$. Suitable choice of \${\textbackslash}delta\$ is vital for {ABC} methods to return good approximations to \${\textbackslash}theta\$ in reasonable computational time. While {ABC} methods are widely used in practice, particularly in population genetics, study of the mathematical properties of {ABC} estimators is still in its infancy. We prove that {ABC} estimates converge to the exact solution under very weak assumptions and, under slightly stronger assumptions, quantify the rate of this convergence. Our results can be used to guide the choice of the tolerance parameter \${\textbackslash}delta\$.},

	abstract = {Stochasticity is a key characteristic of intracellular processes such as gene regulation and chemical signalling. Therefore, characterising stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealisations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with {MATLAB} implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10761},
	abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multiple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-fidelity model describes the system with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations, where the low-fidelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-fidelity model (e.g., a simplified physics approximation, a reduced model, a data-fit surrogate, etc.) that approximates the same output quantity as the high-fidelity model. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are leveraged for speedup while the high-fidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity methods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering. The paper reviews multifidelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncertainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

Their goal is to introduce and motivate basic concepts and constructions (such as orbifolds and stacks) important in the study of moduli spaces of curves and abelian varieties through the example of elliptic curves. The reason for working with elliptic curves is that most constructions are elementary and explicit in this case. All four approaches to moduli spaces of curves -- complex analytic, topological, algebro-geometric, and number theoretic -- are considered. Topics covered reflect my own biases. Very little, if anything, in these notes is original, except perhaps the selection of topics and the point of view.},

In particular, the authors develop a unified treatment of the theory of the 'geometric subgroups' of the classical groups, introduced by Aschbacher, and they answer the questions of maximality and conjugacy and obtain the precise shapes of these groups. Both authors are experts in the field and the book will be of considerable value not only to group theorists, but also to combinatorialists and geometers interested in these techniques and results. Graduate students will find it a very readable introduction to the topic and it will bring them to the very forefront of research in group theory.},

We formalised enough definitions and theorems in topology, algebra and geometry to define perfectoid spaces in the Lean theorem prover. This experiment confirms that a proof assistant can handle complexity in that direction, which is rather different from formalising a long proof about simple objects. It also confirms that mathematicians with no computer science training can become proficient users of a proof assistant in a relatively short period of time. Finally, we observe that formalising a piece of mathematics that is a trending topic boosts the visibility of proof assistants amongst pure mathematicians.},

As a consequence, we obtain two uniform bounds for a two-dimensional family of genus 2 curves: a uniform Manin-Mumford bound for the family over \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$, and a uniform Bogomolov bound for the family over \${\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\}.\$},
