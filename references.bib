  abstract = {This paper is concerned with elucidating a relationship between two common coupling methods for the continuous time Markov chain models utilized in the cell biology literature. The couplings considered here are primarily used in a computational framework by providing reductions in variance for different Monte Carlo estimators, thereby allowing for significantly more accurate results for a fixed amount of computational time. Common applications of the couplings include the estimation of parametric sensitivities via finite difference methods and the estimation of expectations via multi-level Monte Carlo algorithms. While a number of coupling strategies have been proposed for the models considered here, and a number of articles have experimentally compared the different strategies, to date there has been no mathematical analysis describing the connections between them. Such analyses are critical in order to determine the best use for each. In the current paper, we show a connection between the common reaction path (CRP) method and the split coupling (SC) method, which is termed coupled finite differences (CFD) in the parametric sensitivities literature. In particular, we show that the two couplings are both limits of a third coupling strategy we call the "local-CRP" coupling, with the split coupling method arising as a key parameter goes to infinity, and the common reaction path coupling arising as the same parameter goes to zero. The analysis helps explain why the split coupling method often provides a lower variance than does the common reaction path method, a fact previously shown experimentally.},

  abstract = {Tau-leaping is a popular discretization method for generating approximate paths of continuous time, discrete space, Markov chains, notably for biochemical reaction systems. To compute expected values in this context, an appropriate multilevel Monte Carlo form of tau-leaping has been shown to improve efficiency dramatically. In this work we derive new analytic results concerning the computational complexity of multilevel Monte Carlo tau-leaping that are significantly sharper than previous ones. We avoid taking asymptotic limits, and focus on a practical setting where the system size is large enough for many events to take place along a path, so that exact simulation of paths is expensive, making tau-leaping an attractive option. We use a general scaling of the system components that allows for the reaction rate constants and the abundances of species to vary over several orders of magnitude, and we exploit the random time change representation developed by Kurtz. The key feature of the analysis that allows for the sharper bounds is that when comparing relevant pairs of processes we analyze the variance of their difference directly rather than bounding via the second moment. Use of the second moment is natural in the setting of a diffusion equation, where multilevel was first developed and where strong convergence results for numerical methods are readily available, but is not optimal for the Poisson-driven jump systems that we consider here. We also present computational results that illustrate the new analysis.},

  abstract = {We show how to extend a recently proposed multi-level Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational complexity needed to compute expected values of functions of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The extension is non-trivial, exploiting a coupling of the requisite processes that is easy to simulate while providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and in a stark departure from other implementations of multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased estimator that is significantly less computationally expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the basic computational complexity of current approaches that have many names and variants across the scientific literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled chemical reaction networks provide a very important application for this work. Hence, we use this context for our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and computational examples.},

We then review criteria and the useful framework of stochastic approximation, which allows one to systematically optimise generally used criteria, but also analyse the properties of adaptive MCMC algorithms. We then propose a series of novel adaptive algorithms which prove to be robust and reliable in practice. These algorithms are applied to artificial and high dimensional scenarios, but also to the classic mine disaster dataset inference problem.},

This article presents a boundary integral method that can be used to study the motion of rigid particles in three-dimensional periodic Stokes flow with confining walls. A centerpiece of our method is the highly accurate special quadrature method, which is based on a combination of upsampled quadrature and quadrature by expansion, accelerated using a precomputation scheme. The method is demonstrated for rodlike and spheroidal particles, with the confining geometry given by a pipe or a pair of flat walls. A parameter selection strategy for the special quadrature method is presented and tested. Periodic interactions are computed using the spectral Ewald fast summation method, which allows our method to run in O(n log n) time for n grid points in the primary cell, assuming the number of geometrical objects grows while the grid point concentration is kept fixed.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a popular computational method for likelihood-free Bayesian inference. The term "likelihood-free" refers to problems where the likelihood is intractable to compute or estimate directly, but where it is possible to generate simulated data \$X\$ relatively easily given a candidate set of parameters \$\textbackslash theta\$ simulated from a prior distribution. Parameters which generate simulated data within some tolerance \$\textbackslash delta\$ of the observed data \$x\^*\$ are regarded as plausible, and a collection of such \$\textbackslash theta\$ is used to estimate the posterior distribution \$\textbackslash theta\textbackslash,|\textbackslash,X\textbackslash!=\textbackslash!x\^*\$. Suitable choice of \$\textbackslash delta\$ is vital for ABC methods to return good approximations to \$\textbackslash theta\$ in reasonable computational time. While ABC methods are widely used in practice, particularly in population genetics, study of the mathematical properties of ABC estimators is still in its infancy. We prove that ABC estimates converge to the exact solution under very weak assumptions and, under slightly stronger assumptions, quantify the rate of this convergence. Our results can be used to guide the choice of the tolerance parameter \$\textbackslash delta\$.},

Given full aperture far field measurements of the scattered field for multiple angles of incidence, we use Chen's method of recursive linearization to reconstruct an unknown sound speed at resolutions of thousands of square wavelengths in a fully nonlinear regime. Despite the fact that the underlying optimization problem is formally ill-posed and nonconvex, recursive linearization requires only the solution of a sequence of linear least squares problems at successively higher frequencies. By seeking a suitably band-limited approximation of the sound speed profile, we ensure that each least squares calculation is well-conditioned so that an iterative solver can be effectively applied. Each matrix-vector product involves the solution of a large number of forward scattering problems, for which we have created a new, spectrally accurate, fast direct solver. For the largest problems considered, involving 19,600 unknowns, approximately 1 million partial differential equations were solved, requiring approximately 2 days to compute using a parallel MATLAB implementation on a multicore workstation.},

The smoothness of the final surface is an explicit parameter in the method, and the bandlimit of the smoothed surface is proportional to its smoothness. Several numerical examples are provided in the context of acoustic scattering. In particular, we compare scattered fields from smoothed geometries in two dimensions with those from polygonal domains. We observe that significant reductions in computational cost can be obtained if merely approximate solutions are desired in the near- or far-field. Provided that the smoothing is sub-wavelength, the error of the scattered field is proportional to the size of the geometry that is modified.},

In Bayesian inference, first and foremost, MCMC techniques have continued to evolve, moving from random walk proposals to Langevin drift, to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and so on, with both theoretical and algorithmic innovations opening new opportunities to practitioners. However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects. Approximate models and algorithms may thus be at the core of the next computational revolution.},

The advantages of this approach are twofold: first, the velocity is automatically divergence free, and second, complicated (nonlocal) boundary conditions for the vorticity are avoided. The disadvantage is that the solution of a nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equation is required. By recasting this partial differential equation as an integral equation, we avoid the ill-conditioning which hampers finite difference and finite element methods in this environment. By using fast algorithms for the evaluation of volume integrals, we are able to solve the equations using O(M ) or O(M log M ) operations, where M is the number of points in the discretization of the domain.},

Standard quadrature accelerated with a fast hierarchical method for potential field evaluation gives accurate results far away from the sources. Close to the sources this is not so. Cancellation and nearly singular kernels may cause serious degradation. This paper presents a new scheme based on a mix of composite polynomial quadrature, layer density interpolation, kernel approximation, rational quadrature, high polynomial order corrected interpolation and differentiation, temporary panel mergers and splits, and a particular implementation of the GMRES solver. Criteria for which mix is fastest and most accurate in various situations are also supplied. The paper focuses on the solution of the Dirichlet problem for Laplaceâs equation in the plane. In a series of examples we demonstrate the efficiency of the new scheme for interior domains and domains exterior to up to 2000 close-to-touching contours. Densities are computed and potentials are evaluated, rapidly and accurate to almost machine precision, at points that lie arbitrarily close to the boundaries.},

At the channel walls, the normal component of the fluid velocity is described by Darcyâs law, and the tangential component of the fluid velocity is described by the no slip condition. The pressure exterior to the channel is assumed to be constant. Although this problem has been well studied, typical studies assume that the permeability of the wall is small relative to other nondimensional parameters; this work relaxes this assumption and explores a regime in parameter space that has not yet been well studied. A consequence of this relaxation is that transverse velocity is no longer necessarily small when compared with the axial velocity. We use our result to explore how existing asymptotic theories break down in the limit of large permeability for channels of small length.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proves to be powerful for Bayesian inference and in particular for exoplanet radial velocity fitting because MCMC provides more statistical information and makes better use of data than common approaches like chi-square fitting. However, the nonlinear density functions encountered in these problems can make MCMC time-consuming. In this paper, we apply an ensemble sampler respecting affine invariance to orbital parameter extraction from radial velocity data. This new sampler has only one free parameter, and does not require much tuning for good performance, which is important for automatization. The autocorrelation time of this sampler is approximately the same for all parameters and far smaller than MetropolisâHastings, which means it requires many fewer function calls to produce the same number of independent samples. The affine-invariant sampler speeds up MCMC by hundreds of times compared with MetropolisâHastings in the same computing situation. This novel sampler would be ideal for projects involving large data sets such as statistical investigations of planet distribution. The biggest obstacle to ensemble samplers is the existence of multiple local optima; we present a clustering technique to deal with local optima by clustering based on the likelihood of the walkers in the ensemble. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the sampler on real radial velocity data.},

As a result, new approaches are needed to address the problems of model reduction, parameter estimation, model comparison and model invalidation. Here, the authors propose addressing these problems by using Wasserstein pseudometrics to quantify the differences between processes. The method the authors propose is applicable to any bounded continuous-time stochastic process and pseudometrics between processes are defined only in terms of the available outputs. Algorithms for approximating Wasserstein pseudometrics are developed from experimental or simulation data and demonstrate how to optimise parameter values to minimise the pseudometrics. The approach is illustrated with studies of a stochastic toggle switch and of stochastic gene expression in E. coli.},

  abstract = {Statistical signal processing applications usually require the estimation of some parameters of interest given a set of observed data. These estimates are typically obtained either by solving a multi-variate optimization problem, as in the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators, or by performing a multi-dimensional integration, as in the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimators. Unfortunately, analytical expressions for these estimators cannot be found in most real-world applications, and the Monte Carlo (MC) methodology is one feasible approach. MC methods proceed by drawing random samples, either from the desired distribution or from a simpler one, and using them to compute consistent estimators. The most important families of MC algorithms are the Markov chain MC (MCMC) and importance sampling (IS). On the one hand, MCMC methods draw samples from a proposal density, building then an ergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution by accepting or rejecting those candidate samples as the new state of the chain. On the other hand, IS techniques draw samples from a simple proposal density and then assign them suitable weights that measure their quality in some appropriate way. In this paper, we perform a thorough review of MC methods for the estimation of static parameters in signal processing applications. A historical note on the development of MC schemes is also provided, followed by the basic MC method and a brief description of the rejection sampling (RS) algorithm, as well as three sections describing many of the most relevant MCMC and IS algorithms, and their combined use. Finally, five numerical examples (including the estimation of the parameters of a chaotic system, a localization problem in wireless sensor networks and a spectral analysis application) are provided in order to demonstrate the performance of the described approaches.},

  abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multiple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-fidelity model describes the system with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations, where the low-fidelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-fidelity model (e.g., a simplified physics approximation, a reduced model, a data-fit surrogate, etc.) that approximates the same output quantity as the high-fidelity model. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are leveraged for speedup while the high-fidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity methods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering. The paper reviews multifidelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncertainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

We restrict our attention here to the Poisson, modified Helmholtz, Stokes and modified Stokes equations. The approach extends to the oscillatory equations of mathematical physics, including the Helmholtz and Maxwell equations, but we will address these in a companion paper, since the nature of the problem is somewhat different and includes the consideration of quasiperiodic boundary conditions and resonances. Unlike lattice sumbased methods, the scheme is insensitive to the unit cellâs aspect ratio and is easily coupled to adaptive fast multipole methods (FMMs). Our analysis relies on classical âplane-waveâ representations of the fundamental solution, and yields an explicit low-rank representation of the field due to all image sources beyond the first layer of neighboring unit cells. When the aspect ratio of the unit cell is large, our scheme can be coupled with the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to accelerate the evaluation of the induced field. Its performance is illustrated with several numerial examples.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional scattering of water waves over a finite region of arbitrarily  varying topography linking two semi-infinite regions of constant depth is considered.  Unlike many approaches to this problem, the formulation employed is exact in the  context of linear theory, utilizing simple combinations of Green's functions appropriate  to water of constant depth and the CauchyâRiemann equations to derive a  system of coupled integral equations for components of the fluid velocity at certain  locations. Two cases arise, depending on whether the deepest point of the topography  does or does not lie below the lower of the semi-infinite horizontal bed sections.  In each, the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes are related to the incoming  wave amplitudes by a scattering matrix which is defined in terms of inner products  involving the solution of the corresponding integral equation system.             This solution is approximated by using the variational method in conjunction with  a judicious choice of trial function which correctly models the fluid behaviour at the  free surface and near the joins of the varying topography with the constant-depth  sections, which may not be smooth. The numerical results are remarkably accurate,  with just a two-term trial function giving three decimal places of accuracy in the  reflection and transmission coefficents in most cases, whilst increasing the number of  terms in the trial function results in rapid convergence. The method is applied to a  range of examples.},

These algorithms characteristically rely heavily on repeated model simulations. However, whenever the computational cost of simulation is even moderately expensive, the significant burden incurred by likelihood-free algorithms leaves them unviable in many practical applications. The multifidelity approach has been introduced (originally in the context of approximate Bayesian computation) to reduce the simulation burden of likelihood-free inference without loss of accuracy, by using the information provided by simulating computationally cheap, approximate models in place of the model of interest. The first contribution of this work is to demonstrate that multifidelity techniques can be applied in the general likelihood-free Bayesian inference setting. Analytical results on the optimal allocation of computational resources to simulations at different levels of fidelity are derived, and subsequently implemented practically. We provide an adaptive multifidelity likelihood-free inference algorithm that learns the relationships between models at different fidelities and adapts resource allocation accordingly, and demonstrate that this algorithm produces posterior estimates with near-optimal efficiency.},

Likelihood-free parameter inference methods, such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), build Monte Carlo samples of the uncertain parameter distribution by comparing the data with large numbers of model simulations. However, the computational expense of generating these simulations forms a significant bottleneck in the practical application of such methods. We identify how simulations of corresponding cheap, low-fidelity models have been used separately in two complementary ways to reduce the computational expense of building these samples, at the cost of introducing additional variance to the resulting parameter estimates. We explore how these approaches can be unified so that cost and benefit are optimally balanced, and we characterize the optimal choice of how often to simulate from cheap, low-fidelity models in place of expensive, highfidelity models in Monte Carlo ABC algorithms. The resulting early accept/reject multifidelity ABC algorithm that we propose is shown to give improved performance over existing multifidelity and high-fidelity approaches.},

  abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

  abstract = {Models of stochastic processes are widely used in almost all fields of science. Theory validation, parameter estimation, and prediction all require model calibration and statistical inference using data. However, data are almost always incomplete observations of reality. This leads to a great challenge for statistical inference because the likelihood function will be intractable for almost all partially observed stochastic processes. This renders many statistical methods, especially within a Bayesian framework, impossible to implement. Therefore, computationally expensive likelihood-free approaches are applied that replace likelihood evaluations with realisations of the model and observation process. For accurate inference, however, likelihood-free techniques may require millions of expensive stochastic simulations. To address this challenge, we develop a new method based on recent advances in multilevel and multifidelity methods for parameter inference using partially observed Markov processes. Our novel approach combines the multilevel Monte Carlo telescoping summation, applied to a sequence of approximate Bayesian posterior targets, with a multifidelity rejection sampler that learns from computationally inexpensive model approximations to minimise the number of computationally expensive exact simulations required for accurate inference. We present the derivation of our new algorithm for likelihood-free Bayesian inference, discuss practical implementation details, and demonstrate substantial performance improvements. Using examples from systems biology, we demonstrate improvements of more than two orders of magnitude over standard rejection sampling techniques. Our approach is generally applicable to accelerate other sampling schemes, such as sequential Monte Carlo, to enable feasible Bayesian analysis for realistic practical applications in physics, chemistry, biology, epidemiology, ecology and economics. We provide source code implementations of our methods and demonstrations (available at https://github.com/davidwarne/MLMCandMultifidelityForABC).},

Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo variants of approximate Bayesian computation can be effective techniques for sampling posterior distributions in an approximate Bayesian computation setting. However, without careful consideration of convergence criteria and selection of proposal kernels, such methods can lead to very biased inference or computationally inefficient sampling. In contrast, rejection sampling for approximate Bayesian computation, despite being computationally intensive, results in independent, identically distributed samples from the approximated posterior. An alternative method is proposed for the acceleration of likelihood-free Bayesian inference that applies multilevel Monte Carlo variance reduction techniques directly to rejection sampling. The resulting method retains the accuracy advantages of rejection sampling while significantly improving the computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Stochasticity is a key characteristic of intracellular processes such as gene regulation and chemical signalling. Therefore, characterising stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealisations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with MATLAB implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

  abstract = {Reactionâdiffusion models describing the movement, reproduction and death of individuals within a population are key mathematical modelling tools with widespread applications in mathematical biology. A diverse range of such continuum models have been applied in various biological contexts by choosing different flux and source terms in the reactionâdiffusion framework. For example, to describe the collective spreading of cell populations, the flux term may be chosen to reflect various movement mechanisms, such as random motion (diffusion), adhesion, haptotaxis, chemokinesis and chemotaxis. The choice of flux terms in specific applications, such as wound healing, is usually made heuristically, and rarely it is tested quantitatively against detailed cell density data. More generally, in mathematical biology, the questions of model validation and model selection have not received the same attention as the questions of model development and model analysis. Many studies do not consider model validation or model selection, and those that do often base the selection of the model on residual error criteria after model calibration is performed using nonlinear regression techniques. In this work, we present a model selection case study, in the context of cell invasion, with a very detailed experimental data set. Using Bayesian analysis and information criteria, we demonstrate that model selection and model validation should account for both residual errors and model complexity. These considerations are often overlooked in the mathematical biology literature. The results we present here provide a straightforward methodology that can be used to guide model selection across a range of applications. Furthermore, the case study we present provides a clear example where neglecting the role of model complexity can give rise to misleading outcomes.},

We argue that practical identifiability is more challenging than structural identifiability when it comes to modelling experimental data. We discuss that the classical approach based on the Fisher information matrix has severe shortcomings. As an alternative, we propose using the profile likelihood, which is a powerful approach to detect and resolve practical non-identifiability.},

The key ingredient is a set of panel quadrature rules capable of evaluating weakly-singular, nearly-singular and hyper-singular integrals to high accuracy. Near-singular integral evaluation, in particular, is done using an extension of the scheme developed in J. Helsing and R. Ojala, J. Comput. Phys. 227 (2008) 2899â2921. The boundary of the given geometry is âpanelizedâ automatically to achieve user-prescribed precision. We show that this adaptive panel refinement procedure works well in practice even in the case of complex geometries with large number of corners. In one example, for instance, a model 2D vascular network with 378 corners required less than 200K discretization points to obtain a 9-digit solution accuracy.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical algorithm for the construction of efficient, high-order quadratures in two and higher dimensions. Quadrature rules constructed via this algorithm possess positive weights and interior nodes, resembling the Gaussian quadratures in one dimension. In addition, rules can be generated with varying degrees of symmetry, adaptable to individual domains. We illustrate the performance of our method with numerical examples, and report quadrature rules for polynomials on triangles, squares, and cubes, up to degree 50. These formulae are near optimal in the number of nodes used, and many of them appear to be new.},
